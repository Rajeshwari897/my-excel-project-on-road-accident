🚗 Road Accident Analysis – Kaggle Dataset  This project analyzes road accident data obtained from Kaggle to identify the key factors contributing to road accidents and provide actionable suggestions to reduce them. The goal is to understand patterns, trends, and causes behind accidents using data-driven insights.
📌 Dataset Source:
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
Contains road accident records with details such as:
Weather conditions,
Road surface,
Road type,
Vehicle type,
Light conditions,
Accident severity,
Date & time,
Area/location,
Casualties.

🎯 Objective:
Find the major factors causing road accidents.
Analyze accident severity, casualties, and environmental conditions.
Identify patterns to help improve road safety.

Suggest preventive measures and actionable recommendations.

🧠 Key Insights (Findings).
1.Wet or icy roads have higher accident rates.
2.Two-wheelers contribute more to high-severity accidents.
3.Night-time accidents have higher casualties.
4. Urban areas have more accidents, but rural areas have more fatal ones.

💡 Suggestions to Reduce Road Accidents.
Based on the analysis, here are some preventive recommendations:

✔ Infrastructure Improvements
Add proper street lighting on major accident-prone routes.
Improve road surface quality to avoid slipperiness.
Install speed-breakers, reflective signage, and guardrails.

✔ Policy & Government Actions
Stricter enforcement of traffic laws.
Smart traffic monitoring systems (CCTV, speed detection).
Regular road condition inspections.
Mandatory helmet & seatbelt checks.

✔ Awareness & Education
Driver safety training programs.
Public awareness about night driving, speed limits, and drunk driving.
Campaigns on safe driving for two-wheeler riders.

✔ Technology Solutions.
Encourage vehicles with ABS,traction control, and airbags.
Use of GPS and alert applications for risky zones.

🙌 Conclusion.
This study helps identify critical factors responsible for road accidents and offers meaningful suggestions to improve road safety.
Using data-driven insights can help reduce casualties and support smarter decision-making for traffic authorities and policymakers.
